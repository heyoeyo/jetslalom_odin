# Jetslalom (Odin Remake)

This repo contains a remake of an old web game called 'Jet slalom'. The goal of the game is to avoid obstacles as long as possible, through increasingly difficult stages.

This was made to experiment with and learn the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org/). Though my biggest takeaway is that [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/) rocks!

## How to play

Building/compiling the game requires downloading and [installing Odin](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/). For reference, I used the [dev-2025-01](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/dev-2025-01) release from the odinlang github page (pretty painless).

With Odin installed, simply type the following command (in terminal) from the root folder of the repo:
```bash
odin run src
```
And that's it! This command will compile and immediately run the game.
